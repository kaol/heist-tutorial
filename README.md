I felt that compiled Heist was missing a tutorial.  This is mine.

It's written in the hope that other people find it useful and to
clarify my own thinking about the concepts behind it.

The tutorial is organized into a tutorial file, introducing the
underlying concepts of compiled Heist and the provided library
functions, and a cabal project with a series of examples highlighting
various concepts.
