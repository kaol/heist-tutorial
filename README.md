I felt that compiled Heist was missing a tutorial.  This is mine.

It's written in the hope that other people find it useful and to
clarify my own thinking about the concepts behind it.

The tutorial is organized into a tutorial file, introducing the
underlying concepts of compiled Heist and the provided library
functions, and a cabal project with a series of examples highlighting
various concepts.

If you feel that the tutorial could be improved or would like to see
me cover some additional topics, feel free to open an issue or even
make a pull request.
